- Lane: validation
- Depends on: API-GATE-001
- Production writes: **no**
- Branch from: `develop` as `agent/API-VAL-002-scheduling-smoke`

## Agent prompt

Using the API-GATE-001 environment, smoke-test session CRUD, attendance, cron
auth on Discord routes (if webhook configured in non-prod), and subscription
enrollment. Record results. No production writes.

## Allowed paths
