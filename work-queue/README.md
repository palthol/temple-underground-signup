# API work queue

`queue.json` is the machine-readable index. `tasks/<ID>.md` is the brief an agent
must follow. Production writes default to **not authorized**.

Doc map: `docs/README.md`. Historical checklists live in `docs/archive/`.

## Agent start (do this in order)

1. Cursor Cloud: refresh `develop` before trusting this file or `queue.json`.
   Snapshot working trees can lag the commit (`git fetch origin develop`,
   `git checkout develop`, `git pull origin develop`, then confirm `HEAD`
   matches `origin/develop` and on-disk `queue.json` matches
   `git show HEAD:work-queue/queue.json`). Full note: `AGENTS.md` →
   **Cursor Cloud specific instructions**. Skip if already fast-forwarded.
2. Read `docs/current-state.md` and this file.
3. In `queue.json`, pick a task with `"status": "ready"` whose `depends_on` IDs are
   all `"done"`. Prefer the parallel batch below when starting a new session.
4. Open `work-queue/tasks/<ID>.md`. If you cannot satisfy its constraints, stop.
5. Copy `claims/TEMPLATE.md` to `claims/<ID>.md`. **If that path already exists,
   do not take the task.**
6. Branch from `develop`: `agent/<ID>-short-slug`.
7. Implement only the brief. Record commands in the claim. Commit on the branch.
8. On success: set the task `"status": "done"` in `queue.json` and this table,
   fill the claim evidence, update `docs/current-state.md` only if the brief says
   to. Do not flip a successor to `ready` unless every dependency is `done`.

## Shared files (every task may touch)

- `work-queue/claims/<ID>.md`
- `work-queue/queue.json` (your row only)
- `work-queue/README.md` (your row only)
- `docs/current-state.md` (only when the brief requires evidence)

Do not rewrite other tasks' rows. Parallel agents: `API-DEV-001` and
`API-OPS-001` must not share exclusive paths.
