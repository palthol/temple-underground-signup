# Schema Changes and Admin API Alignment

> **Historical snapshot** (migrations `0001`–`0012` only). Not the live schema.
> Current truth is `supabase/migrations/` through **`0021`**, [api-schema-audit.md](../../api-schema-audit.md), and [admin-api.md](../../admin-api.md).

This document compares the prior process documentation in `operations-table-process-map.md` against the schema represented by:

- `supabase/migrations/0001_foundation_schema.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0002_business_logic_and_affiliations.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0003_security_hardening.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0004_reporting_views_and_monitoring.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0005_charge_adjustments.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0006_refunds_merge_upgrade_rpcs.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0007_fix_entitlements_merge_credits_grants.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0008_pay_per_class_charge_and_upgrade.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0009_upgrade_policy_mode_for_per_class_conversion.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0010_event_ledger_foundation.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0011_phase2_high_impact_ops_finance_views.sql`
- `supabase/migrations/0012_phase3_analytics_views.sql`

The schema above was treated as the intended source of truth **at the time this note was written**. Later migrations (`0013`–`0021`) supersede that cutoff.

## 1) Changes vs Previous Operations Map

Previous doc baseline: `operations-table-process-map.md`.

### Added process areas not captured in previous doc

1. **Charge Adjustments / Write-Offs**
  - Added table: `charge_adjustments`
  - Added enforcement triggers/functions:
    - `enforce_charge_adjustment_totals()`
    - `enforce_affiliate_application_totals()`
  - Impact: net due now explicitly supports write-offs in addition to affiliate credits.
2. **Payment Refund Operations**
  - Added table: `payment_refunds`
  - Added RPC: `record_payment_refund(...)`
  - Behavior:
    - Refund creates `payment_refunds` row (idempotency supported by `idempotency_key`).
    - Refund reduces `payment_allocations` FIFO.
    - Charges can reopen (`paid` -> `open`) when allocations fall below net due.
    - Full cumulative refund sets `payments.status = 'refunded'` (added in migration `0007`).
3. **Participant Merge / Canonicalization**
  - Added columns on `participants`:
    - `merged_into_participant_id`
    - `merged_at`
  - Added RPC: `merge_participants(...)`
  - Behavior: moves references to canonical participant and marks duplicate as merged (no hard delete).
  - `0007` improvement: dedupes conflicting active `affiliate_referrals` rows after merge.
4. **Subscription Upgrade with Proration**
  - Added RPC: `upgrade_subscription_prorated(...)`
  - Behavior: upgrade-only flow (new plan must be higher price), creates prorated delta charge, updates subscription plan.
5. **Monitoring Views**
  - Added views:
    - `view_orphan_waivers`
    - `view_orphan_waiver_summary`
  - Operational use: identify waiver participants not linked into billing account membership.
6. **Pay-Per-Class Operations**
  - Added table: `class_charge_links`
  - Added RPCs:
    - `create_pay_per_class_charge(...)`
    - `upgrade_per_class_to_monthly(...)`
  - Behavior:
    - manual class charge creation from `attendance_records` (`present` only)
    - idempotency at attendance level via unique link
    - conversion from `per_session` to `monthly` with no credit carryover
7. **Explicit Conversion Policy Mode**
  - Upgraded RPC signature:
    - `upgrade_per_class_to_monthly(..., p_conversion_policy text)`
  - Allowed values:
    - `no_credit`
    - `manual_writeoff_allowed`
  - Impact:
    - makes admin intent explicit and auditable in notes
    - avoids semantic confusion between monthly upgrade paths
8. **Event Ledger Foundation**
  - Added tables:
    - `event_ledger` (append-only event store)
    - `event_reason_codes` (controlled cause vocabulary)
    - `event_capture_config` (capture toggles/settings)
  - Added helpers:
    - `private.append_event(...)`
    - `private.event_capture_enabled(...)`
    - `public.capture_event_ledger_phase1()`
  - Added phase-1 triggers for:
    - `participants`, `subscriptions`, `charges`, `payments`,
    `payment_allocations`, `waivers`, `attendance_records`
  - Impact:
    - historical causality and timeline reconstruction are now supported at DB level.
9. **Phase 2 High-Impact Ops/Finance Views (DB-only)**
  - Added views:
    - `view_ops_today_sessions`
    - `view_ops_upcoming_access_issues`
    - `view_ops_waiver_compliance_gaps`
    - `view_ops_ar_aging`
    - `view_ops_unallocated_or_partial_payment_risk`
  - Impact:
    - adds actionable queues for front-desk logistics, access risk, compliance risk,
    AR prioritization, and billing allocation integrity.
10. **Phase 3 Analytics Views (DB-ready)**
  - Added analytics views:
    - `view_analytics_revenue_waterfall_monthly`
    - `view_analytics_subscription_movement`
    - `view_analytics_attendance_utilization_weekly`
    - `view_analytics_entitlement_burn`
    - `view_analytics_affiliate_program_performance`
    - `view_analytics_data_hygiene`
  - Impact:
    - expands decision-support from ops queues into monthly/weekly trend analytics.

### Changed logic compared to earlier schema behavior

1. **Entitlement remaining math fixed (`0007`)**
  - `participant_entitlement_status.remaining` now aligns with `has_availability` for limited plans:
  - Remaining = `max(0, limit - usage - credits_available)`.
2. **Affiliate credit application headroom fixed (`0007`)**
  - `apply_credits_to_account(...)` now caps by `view_charge_net.net_due_cents` (write-off aware), not gross charge amount.
3. **Function exposure hardened (`0007`)**
  - Internal billing/affiliate functions revoked from `public`, `anon`, `authenticated`.
  - Execute privilege granted to `service_role` only.

### Existing groups from prior doc that still remain valid

- Intake identity and billing binding: `participants`, `accounts`, `account_members`
- Plan setup: `plan_definitions`, `plan_entitlements`
- Enrollment: `subscriptions`
- Billing core ledger: `charges`, `payments`, `payment_allocations`
- Attendance and entitlement usage: `schedule_templates`, `sessions`, `attendance_records`, `private_usage`, `entitlement_credits`, `access_overrides`
- Waiver/compliance: `waivers`, `audit_trails`, `emergency_contacts`, `waiver_medical_histories`
- Affiliate/family structures: `participant_relationships`, `affiliate_referrals`, `affiliate_credits`, `affiliate_credit_applications`
- Admin access control: `app_admin`, `private.is_admin()`, admin-only RLS policies

---

## 2) Current Schema Documentation (Canonical Operational Model)

### A. Intake and Billing Identity

- Tables: `participants`, `accounts`, `account_members`
- Purpose: identity capture + payer relationship modeling
- Key integrity:
  - unique member binding per `(account_id, participant_id)`
  - account-member role checks (`member|payer|guardian`)

### B. Plan and Enrollment

- Tables: `plan_definitions`, `plan_entitlements`, `subscriptions`
- Purpose: define plans and attach participants to plans
- Key integrity:
  - entitlement constraints for `scope`, `unit`, `limit_type`, quantity logic
  - subscription status/date constraints

### C. Billing Ledger and Net Due

- Core tables: `charges`, `payments`, `payment_allocations`
- Adjustment tables: `affiliate_credit_applications`, `charge_adjustments`, `payment_refunds`
- Net due model:
  - `view_charge_net.net_due_cents = gross - affiliate credits - write_offs`
- Key operational rules:
  - adjustments + affiliate credits cannot exceed gross (trigger-enforced)
  - refund cannot exceed payment amount or payment allocations

### D. Attendance and Entitlements

- Tables: `schedule_templates`, `sessions`, `attendance_records`, `private_usage`, `entitlement_credits`, `access_overrides`
- View/function:
  - `participant_entitlement_status`
  - `can_attend_group_session(...)`
- Behavior:
  - usage tracked by attendance/private minutes
  - credits and override affect access availability

### E. Waiver and Compliance

- Tables: `waivers`, `audit_trails`, `emergency_contacts`, `waiver_medical_histories`
- View: `view_waiver_documents`
- Purpose: legal signature + medical/contact records + audit linkage

### F. Affiliate and Family

- Tables: `participant_relationships`, `affiliate_referrals`, `affiliate_credits`, `affiliate_credit_applications`
- Functions:
  - `create_affiliation(...)`
  - `record_payment_affiliate_credits(...)`
  - `get_referrer_credit_balance(...)`
  - `apply_credits_to_account(...)`

### G. Lifecycle Corrections and Data Hygiene

- Participant dedupe:
  - `merge_participants(...)`
  - `participants.merged_into_participant_id`, `participants.merged_at`
- Plan lifecycle change:
  - `upgrade_subscription_prorated(...)`
  - `upgrade_per_class_to_monthly(...)`

### H. Reporting and Monitoring Views

- Billing views:
  - `view_member_payment_board`
  - `view_member_payment_reminders`
  - `view_charge_net`
- Waiver and monitoring views:
  - `view_waiver_documents`
  - `view_orphan_waivers`
  - `view_orphan_waiver_summary`
- Entitlement view:
  - `participant_entitlement_status`

### I. Security and Access

- `app_admin` + `private.is_admin()` based RLS policy pattern
- Broad table RLS enabled with admin-only policy checks
- Sensitive RPCs restricted to `service_role` execute (migrations `0007` through `0009`)
- Event ledger tables follow admin-only RLS; ledger rows are append-only by trigger.

### Conventions in `docs/admin-api.md` vs schema

- Service-role-only execution for internal RPCs: **Match** (explicit revoke/grant in migrations `0007` through `0009`).
- Partial payment and net due guidance using `view_charge_net`: **Match**.
- Refund idempotency guidance: **Match** (`payment_refunds.idempotency_key` unique when present).

### Notes and caveats

1. The API route implementations use service-role Supabase client for admin endpoints, which is consistent with function privilege hardening.
2. Any client/UI that builds allocation workflows should enforce net-due and payment-allocation caps before writing, as the doc states.
3. Reporting endpoint is schema-aligned and slug whitelist matches currently defined views.

## 4) Conclusion

Using migrations `0001` through `0012` as the intended schema, the admin API documentation in `docs/admin-api.md` is aligned with current database design and RPC behavior.

The previous operations map remains directionally correct for core flows, but it should be considered incomplete unless it includes:

- write-offs/adjustments,
- payment refunds,
- pay-per-class class charging and conversion,
- participant merge/canonicalization,
- subscription proration upgrades, and
- orphan-waiver monitoring.
