# API ↔ Supabase schema audit (live verification)

**Date:** 2026-09-03 (updated; original audit 2026-05-29)

**Product map:** [api-capability-audit.md](./api-capability-audit.md) (notifications, finance, scheduling).  
**Project:** Temple Underground — Supabase `jhxzecxkccqlgyazhsnb` (production, live traffic)
**Audited API:** `services/api` (this repo — the deployed admin/waiver API)
**Method:** Live introspection of the production database (tables, views, functions,
columns, check constraints) cross-checked against every route in
`services/api/src/routes/**` and the services/lib it calls.

> This is the authoritative API repo. The `admin/` repo's `services/api` scaffold was
> retired in favor of this service — do not re-introduce a second backend.

---

## TL;DR

The API code is **structurally aligned** with the database: every RPC it calls, every
view it reads, and every column it writes exists in the live schema with matching names,
types, and check-constraint vocabularies.

All expected schema changes are present in production. `list_migrations` returns
`0001`–`0020` plus `20260608191715_marketing_leads_first_last_name`. The repository holds
the same last change as `0021_marketing_leads_first_last_name.sql`; reconcile that version
identifier before the next push rather than assuming migration history is identical.

Remaining work is **operational smoke-testing** (finance, scheduling, subscriptions) and
**engineering hardening** (non-transactional write paths — see §3).

---

## 1. Migration status

`list_migrations` on the live project returns **`0001`–`0020`** plus timestamped migration
**`20260608191715`**. The repo's `supabase/migrations/` folder contains **21 migrations**;
the final file is numbered `0021` locally but represents the timestamped live change.

| Migration | Creates | API code that depends on it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0017_personal_finance_entries.sql` | table `personal_finance_entries` (+ checks, RLS, indexes) | `billing.js`: `POST/GET /billing/personal-finance-entries`, `POST .../:id/invoice-status` |
| `0018_fix_private_schema_grants_for_event_capture.sql` | `grant usage on schema private` + execute grants to `service_role` for event-capture functions | waiver submission path (`participants` INSERT → event-capture trigger → `private.*`) |
| `0019_charge_discounts.sql` | table `charge_discounts`, trigger `charge_discounts_set_applied_amount()`, discount-aware rewrite of `view_charge_net`, total-guard triggers, `charges.amount_cents` lock trigger | `billing.js`: `GET/POST /billing/charge-discounts` (and the discount line in the receipts "Formal billing" tab) |
| `0020_tier1_subscription_and_session_cancel.sql` | `sessions.cancelled_at`, RPC `create_subscription(...)`, updated `view_ops_today_sessions` | `billing.js`: `POST /billing/subscriptions`; `scheduling.js`: session list/get/create/patch + attendance upsert |

**Verification (2026-09-03):**

```sql
select table_name from information_schema.tables
where table_schema='public' and table_name in ('personal_finance_entries','charge_discounts');
-- expect 2 rows

select column_name from information_schema.columns
where table_schema='public' and table_name='sessions' and column_name='cancelled_at';
-- expect 1 row

select proname from pg_proc p
join pg_namespace n on n.oid = p.pronamespace
where n.nspname = 'public' and proname = 'create_subscription';
-- expect 1 row
```

## 2. Endpoint-by-endpoint alignment

Legend: **OK** = exists & matches.

### Billing (`routes/admin/billing.js`)

| Endpoint | DB objects | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /billing/external-counterparty-accounts` | `accounts` (insert; `status='active'`) | OK — `accounts.status` check allows `active`/`inactive` |
| `GET /billing/charge-discounts` | `charge_discounts` | OK |
| `POST /billing/charge-discounts` | `charge_discounts` (+ `view_charge_net`) | OK — see §3 note on `applied_amount_cents` |
| `POST /billing/charge-adjustments` | `charge_adjustments` | OK — `adjustment_type='write_off'`, `amount_cents>0` match checks |
| `POST /billing/payment-refunds` | RPC `record_payment_refund(p_payment_id,p_amount_cents,p_reason,p_created_by,p_idempotency_key)` | OK — signature matches exactly |

## 3. Notes & non-blocking observations

1. **`charge_discounts` `applied_amount_cents: 1` is intentional, not a bug.** `billing.js`
   inserts a placeholder `1`; migration `0019`'s `BEFORE INSERT` trigger
   `charge_discounts_set_applied_amount()` overwrites it server-side
   (flat = `least(gross, flat_amount_cents)`, percent = `floor(gross*bps/10000)`). The
   API then re-reads `view_charge_net.net_due_cents` for the response. **Do not "fix" the
   `1` to compute in JS** — that would double-handle the math and diverge from the DB
   source of truth.

2. **Some write paths are not atomic (all-or-nothing).** An **atomic** operation either
   completes every step successfully or rolls back as if nothing happened — the client
   never sees a half-finished state. These handlers perform **sequential** database/storage
   steps without a single Postgres transaction wrapping them:

   - **`record-payment`:** payment → allocations → receipt. A failure after the payment
     insert can leave a payment with partial/no allocations or no receipt.
   - **`POST /api/waivers/submit`:** storage uploads → waiver row → audit row (and related
     rows). A failure after storage upload or waiver insert can leave orphaned files or
     duplicate waivers if the client retries after a 500.

   Recommendation (future hardening, not an alignment issue): move multi-step writes into
   a single Postgres RPC (e.g. `record_payment(...)`) or add idempotency keys, mirroring
   `record_payment_refund`.

3. **Response envelope.** This API returns `200` with `{ ok: true, ... }` on success and
   `{ ok: false, error }` on failure. The receipts client (`adminFetch`) keys off
   `res.ok` (any 2xx) and reads `data.<field>` / `data.error`, so the envelope is
   consistent with the consumer. (The retired admin-repo spec described `201` for creates;
   the real API uses `200` — the design docs in the `admin/` repo reflect the real
   behavior.)

4. **Authorization model is correct.** `/api/admin/*` is gated by `x-admin-key`;
   `/api/viewer/*` uses Cloudflare Access JWT + email allowlist; the service uses the
   Supabase **service-role** client (bypasses RLS), so each route is responsible for its
   own authz. No admin route bypasses the key.

## 4. Production usage snapshot (live, 2026-09-03)

Counts confirm **live production traffic**. Integrity checks were clean:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| participants | 32 |
| participants merged (`merged_into_participant_id` set) | 0 |
| participants with no `account_members` link | **0** (every participant is tethered to an account) |
| waivers | 36 |
| waivers with null `participant_id` | **0** |
| waivers with no matching `audit_trails` row | **0** |
| audit_trails | 12 |
| charges / payments / receipts | 0 / 0 / 0 (formal billing not yet exercised) |
| subscriptions / sessions / attendance | 0 / 0 / 0 |
| personal finance / operating expenses / marketing leads | 0 / 0 / 0 |

The 2026-09-03 refresh checked usage counts and migration/schema presence; it did not rerun
every integrity query from the 2026-06-01 audit. See the workspace
`docs/current-state.md` for the current verification boundary.

## 5. Action checklist

- [x] **Apply migrations `0017`–`0020`** to the live project (confirmed 2026-06-01).
- [x] Verify `personal_finance_entries`, `charge_discounts`, `sessions.cancelled_at`, and
      `create_subscription` exist on production.
- [x] Smoke-test finance endpoints (personal-finance, charge-discounts, record-payment). (API-VAL-001, local Supabase + local API)
- [x] Smoke-test Tier 1 endpoints (scheduling CRUD, subscription enrollment, cron auth). (API-VAL-002, local Supabase + local API; Discord webhook unset → `discord_webhook_not_configured`)
- [ ] (Optional hardening) Wrap `record-payment` and waiver submit in atomic RPCs or add
      idempotency keys.
- [x] Historical schema-alignment note archived at
      `docs/archive/working/schema-changes-and-admin-api-alignment.md` (pinned to
      `0001`–`0012`; not current truth).
